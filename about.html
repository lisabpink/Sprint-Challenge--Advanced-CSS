        <p>
                For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

                There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

                We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

        <p>
          Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an
          equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if
          free men make it.
